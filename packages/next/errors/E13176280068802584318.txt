Image with src "%s" has "placeholder='blur'" property but is missing the "blurDataURL" property.
          Possible solutions:
            - Add a "blurDataURL" property, the contents should be a small Data URL to represent the image
            - Change the "src" property to a static import with one of the supported file types: %s (animated images not supported)
            - Remove the "placeholder" property, effectively no blur effect
